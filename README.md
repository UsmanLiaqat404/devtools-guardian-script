## 🌟 Features

- **🚫 No Right-Click**: Say goodbye to context menus and hello to peace of mind.
- **🔑 Shortcut Blocker**: Blocks those sneaky developer keyboard shortcuts.
- **🕵️‍♂️ DevTools Detective**: If they somehow still sneak in, we have a backup plan! Detects when DevTools might be open and hides your secrets.
- **📏 Dynamic Styling**: Reacts to window height changes for some snazzy style tweaks.

## 🔍 How It Works

1. **Context Menu Blocker**:
    - Right-clicking is often a gateway to the console. We've blocked it.

2. **Key Guardian**:
    - Those keyboard shortcuts? Yeah, we're watching them. F12, Ctrl+Shift+I, Ctrl+Shift+C, Ctrl+Shift+J, and Ctrl+U have been taken care of.

3. **Aspect Ratio Watchdog**:
    - A change in the window's aspect ratio could mean that DevTools is open. We keep an eye on that, and if things look fishy, we take action!

4. **Stylish Protector**:
    - For those more design-oriented, we've added a touch of dynamic styling for smaller window heights.

## 💻 Usage

To protect your page:

1. **Integrate the Script**:
    - Embed the JavaScript code in your HTML file.
  
2. **Customize for Your Page**:
    - The script references specific IDs (`car-container` and `customization`). Make sure they're relevant or adjust as needed.

## ⚠️ Gentle Reminder

This script is a guardian, not a fortress. While it deters casual onlookers, those with determination can still bypass it. Always manage sensitive data and operations on the server-side.
